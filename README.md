Fernando R. (fr2510) Team 202305-12 AI System On Chip final project for Columbia University's EECS 6895 Advanced Big Data & AI.

This project aims to explore the nuances and benefits of training and utilizing Embedded AI methodologies on dedicated Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) devices compared to Neural Processing Unit (NPU) embedded devices enabling the development of small scale, local, or independent AI embedded platforms. All of the available folders contain all of resulting data and the material required to reproduce the findings of this AI System on Chip research project.
